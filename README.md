# BERT_Summarisation
This project demonstrates how to use BERT sentence representations for text summarization

In this project, I have used the openly avalibale bert-as-service API to convert any given sentence into a vectorized form. 

Once the sentences are vectorized, I used Kmeans clustering to find out the symantically close sentences out of which summary sentences can be picked.
